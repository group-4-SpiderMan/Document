# Weather is a natural phenomenon 

Weather is a natural phenomenon that is always with us in our daily life. 
    
Good weather can make people feel comfortable, for example, people tend to go out and feel better on sunny days. 

On the contrary, continuous rain can create a depressed mood and make people lack energy. In winter, heavy snow can hinder travelling, but the      beautiful snow scenery is also intoxicating and makes people forget their worries.

# In ancient times

In ancient times, people formulated the 24 solar terms according to the law of weather changes as a guide for farming life. 

As human civilization progresses, a variety of occupations emerged, many of which are equally affected by the weather, and for most of them, they prefer to work in the right weather.

# **Aerial workers** are particularly sensitive to weather changes

**Aerial workers** are particularly sensitive to weather changes, and they have very demanding working conditions. 

Gusty winds and heavy rain not only make the work more difficult, but also more dangerous. 

Therefore, we decided to select the **spider man** as the target group and design a weather forecast program to help them determine whether they are suitable for work at the moment. 

Based on safety considerations, this requires our app to have extremely high accuracy. Due to the changeable weather, we added warnings of dangerous conditions to avoid unexpected situations. 

**Spider man** can check the weather in their city before they work each day and get work advice given by the program. In this way, we envision to apply what we have learned in real life and provide services to our target population.
